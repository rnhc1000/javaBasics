 * The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that 
 * high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, 
 * but both should depend on abstractions. 
 * Abstractions should not depend on details â€“ 
 * details should depend on abstractions.
 * This principle aims to reduce coupling between modules, 
 * increase modularity, and make the code easier to maintain, 
 * test, and extend.
